# LegoBrickClassification
This project is inspired by Jacques Mattheij's blog entry: [Sorting 2 Metric Tons of Lego][1] who uses a Deep Learning approach to sort Lego bricks. Our first goal is to improve the software side, especially creating a generic dataset for the neural network training.
Due to the high number of bricks (10000+) and the related similarities, we plan a meaningful combination of categories and single bricks as classification task.
